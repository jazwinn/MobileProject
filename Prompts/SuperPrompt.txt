## Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Language:** Kotlin
- **UI Framework:** Jetpack Compose
- **Database:** Room (SQLite)
- **Computer Vision:** OpenCV for Android
- **Architecture Pattern:** MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- **Dependency Injection:** Hilt/Koin
- **Coroutines:** For asynchronous operations
- **Flow/LiveData:** For reactive data streams

### Key Components

**1. Services:**
- Foreground Service for background step counting
- WorkManager for periodic data syncing/cleanup

**2. Sensors:**
- Step Detector/Counter sensor access
- Camera2 API or CameraX for camera access

**3. Permissions Required:**
- `ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION` - for step counting
- `CAMERA` - for exercise detection
- `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` - for goal notifications (Android 13+)
- `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` - for background tracking
- `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` (if needed for older Android versions)

  - Option 2: Integration with MediaPipe Pose or TensorFlow Lite pose estimation models
- Real-time frame processing pipeline:
  - Camera frame capture
  - Preprocessing (resize, color conversion)
  - Pose detection
  - Rep counting logic (state machine based on joint angles)
  - Form validation (angle thresholds for proper form)
- Performance optimization:
  - Frame rate throttling (process every nth frame)
  - Background thread processing
  - GPU acceleration if available

## Exercise Detection Logic

### Push-up Detection:
**Key Points to Track:**
- Shoulders, elbows, hips, knees
- Rep counted when:
  - Elbow angle goes from ~180° (up) to <90° (down) and back
  - Body maintains straight line (plank position)
- Form validation:
  - Check hip alignment
  - Elbow angle depth
  - Back straightness

### Sit-up Detection:
**Key Points to Track:**
- Head, shoulders, hips, knees
- Rep counted when:
  - Torso angle relative to ground goes from ~0° (lying) to >45° (sitting up) and back
- Form validation:
  - Knee bend consistency
  - Full range of motion
  - Controlled movement speed

## Data Flow & User Journey

### First-Time User:
1. Onboarding screens explaining features
2. Request necessary permissions (activity recognition, camera)
3. User profile setup (height, weight, age, goal)
4. Enable/disable background tracking preference
5. Brief tutorial for camera exercise feature

### Daily Usage:
1. Open app → View today's progress on dashboard
2. Automatic step counting in background (if enabled)
3. User initiates workout session → Camera opens
4. Select exercise type → Real-time detection begins
5. Complete workout → Save to database → Show summary
6. View history → Analyze trends → Share achievements

### Background Behavior:
- Step counting service runs continuously (if enabled)
- Periodic database updates (every hour or significant step count change)
- Battery optimization considerations
- Proper service lifecycle management

## Additional Considerations

### Performance:
- Efficient database queries with indexing
- Lazy loading for history lists
- Image/bitmap recycling for camera frames
- Memory management for long-running services

### Error Handling:
- Graceful degradation if sensors unavailable
- Camera permission denied fallback
- Database migration strategies
- Network-independent operation (fully offline capable)

### Future Extensibility:
- Modular architecture to add more exercises
- Cloud sync capability preparation
- Multi-user profile support
- Integration with wearables (optional)
- Gamification elements (badges, achievements)

### Testing Requirements:
- Unit tests for business logic (calorie calculation, rep counting algorithm)
- UI tests for navigation flows
- Integration tests for database operations
- Camera/sensor mocking for testing detection logic

## Success Criteria
- Step counting accuracy within 5% of device pedometer
